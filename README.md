The data set is gathered from global record on world vaccination and the various products deployed over a period of time.

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to create insight into the vaccination achievements and level of fully vaccinated people in the world in order to ascertain the success of the fight against the pandemic

## Findings and Statistical Analysis:
The dataset contains 86,512 rows and 15 columns. The data gathered was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure its level of integrity and quality

## Insight Generated:
It was revealed that billion doses of vaccines have been deployed and various products was created. The top five product deployed during the period 2020 to 2022 are Pfizer -  435,674,274,549 doses, Modena – 398,407,196,851 doses, Johnson & Johnson – 352,818,314,868 doses, Oxford/AstraZeneca and Novavax having 239,836,763,776 and 121,509,513,056 doses respectively. Although production of vaccines started slowly in 2020 but got to its peak in 2021 with a total of 1,217,584,832,178 doses of vaccine produced
Also, the percentage of fully vaccinated people increased greatly in 2021 (57.78%) but later declined in 2022 (42.22%) due to reduced effect of the pandemic.

## Recommendation:
Awareness should be created to enlighten people especially from the developing nations to get vaccinated as most of the people still feels there is a negative effect attached to the vaccine.
The gains recorded due to the prompt creation of vaccine to fight the deadly covid19 virus is applauded, more scientific effort should be made to create more advanced vaccine as a proactive measure for subsequent virus emergence
